# hello-world
I am new to github and like to learn some skill about secure linux distributions like Qubes RC 4 and else. And of course I like to support and help other people, if I got something solved.
I was a Windows user for about 15 years and for a few month I switched to Qubes Rc 4, because I like to get a more secure system and I enjoy working with vm's. Now I am learning things about Debian 10, Fedora-30 and need some help here to build my computer-system like I want.
I am running windows 10 and qubes rc4 at a one SSD at different partitions and my goal is to run Windows 10 in seamless mode on Qubes, like u can do with win7, that I don't need my Windowspartition anymore. But there are a few problems left and I need to learn some more things about Linux first. 
Stay healthy community and if u have a question I am always here and try to help, too!

More very soon:)

Big blesses
